.togglerGroup()
================

The togglerGroup plugin is a layout- and style-neutral plugin for adding tab-like behavior.
Because it assumes nothing about layout and style, it can be used for scenarios far beyond tabs
as well.

Another common scenario would be an image gallery, where a set of thumbnails is the
"toggler group", pointing to a set of images, which should only be visible one at a time.

The idea is that the html markup contains a set of links which point to a set of target elements
in the page. All but one of the target elements will be hidden, and the visible ("active")
target can be changed by clicking on the respective links in the toggler group.
